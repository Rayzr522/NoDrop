# NoDrop
Just a quick note, this is another request by *xOrlxndo*. I hope you enjoy!

**NoDrop** is a Bukkit plugin which allows you to prevent items from being dropped in specific worlds, as well as preventing the inventory from be interacted with. Each event listener can be toggled in the config.
